# ica-vs2019-layout
Download Visual Studio 2019 and create a layout folder on the opsi server

The Visual Studio Installer will download and save the layout files in a folder on
the local computer that this script runs on (be sure that there is enough free file
storage space!). After the installer finishes, the script will copy the layout files
to the opsi server and delete the local copy.
